- DONE: Familiarity with the rtmidi API (No desire to continue this using C++)
- DONE: rtmidi with Python
- DONE: PTQ cli parse for preset names
- DONE: Preset names to PTQ MIDI map
- DONE: Instrument names (from ptq's pov)

- PTQ prefs:
  Located at ~/.config/Modartt/Pianoteq65\ STAGE.prefs 
  Can specify file to store prefs at startup on cli, can we supply our own?
  It's an XML file.

- Midi Mappings
  Located in ~/.local/share/Modartt/Pianoteq/MidiMappings
  Can specify midi mapping by name at startup
  Extend Mapping with 'minimalistic' or 'full featured' mappings, and allow setting other params

- DONE: Mock my interface as CLI - use something like prompt_toolkit
- TODO: Create interface for gfxhat.
  - DONE: Prev/Next instrument
  - DONE: Instrument backlight colours
  - Select preset/instrument via menu
  - Turn off/quit via menu
  - DONE: Display instrument and preset
  - Scrolling text / multiline for long names
  - Display MidiIn events
  - Piano images
- TODO: Run Headless, at boot? with minimal startup screen / selector?
- Common PTQ setup as method in client lib?
- DONE: Consolidate instruments etc in application config
- Support custom preset groupings/banks

- DONE: Think about artifact for Pi, (add CI/CD)
  Easy to install pre-built deb package for python3-rtmidi, but prompt_toolkit is a major version lower...
  TODO: Build a deb package as artifact, include python3-rtmidi as dependency?
  TODO: Alternatively, clarify dependencies in steps to install:
        - install gfxhat (pimoroni)
        - install python3-rtmidi
        - optionally install cpupower
        - optionally install prompt-toolikt
  DONE: Package the remainder with pip / setuptools
  TODO: Rename to ptqpi
