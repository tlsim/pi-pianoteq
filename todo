- PTQ prefs:
  Located at ~/.config/Modartt/Pianoteq65\ STAGE.prefs 
  Can specify file to store prefs at startup on cli, can we supply our own?
  It's an XML file.

- Midi Mappings
  Located in ~/.local/share/Modartt/Pianoteq/MidiMappings
  Can specify midi mapping by name at startup
  Create with mapping.py classes
  Extend Mapping with 'minimalistic' or 'full featured' mappings, and allow setting other params

- Mock my interface as CLI - use something like prompt_toolkit
- Create interface for gfxhat.
- Consolidate instruments etc in yaml config
- Support custom preset groupings/banks
