- Familiarity with the rtmidi API 
- rtmidi with Python / Cython
- try Mido python lib
- PTQ cli parse for preset names
- Preset names to PTQ MIDI map (is this midi device specific?, looks like not)
- PTQ prefs:
  Located at ~/.config/Modartt/Pianoteq65\ STAGE.prefs 
  Can specify file to store prefs at startup on cli, can we supply our own?
  It's an XML file.

- Midi Mappings
  Located in ~/.local/share/Modartt/Pianoteq/MidiMappings
  Can specify midi mapping by name at startup
  Looks like a binary file.
